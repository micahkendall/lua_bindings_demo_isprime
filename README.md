My (Micah Kendall's) demo for my level 1 & 2 Info 1111 self learning project

Compile using
"gcc main.c -llua"

Product file is a.out which can be ran in the same directory as demo.lua

This demo showcases how I use lua to dynamically generate scripts with an efficient C backend.
This allows for a pipeline where for a set of numbers, my C factorial function is fed into my C is prime function.
